GENERAL INFORMATION

In this project we will be working on a basic fitness center visitor data management program. He
has three branches (Club Mercury, Club Neptune and Club
Jupiter). Visitors are also divided into two categories: visitors of one club (Single Club Member) and visitors
several clubs (Multi Club Members).

A visitor to one club is only allowed access to his own club. On the other hand, visitors to several
clubs all three clubs are available. The size of the membership fee depends on whether you use
a visitor using the services of one or more clubs. For visitors to one club, the amount of payment also depends
depending on which club he has access to.

The application uses a CSV file to store information about each visitor. Every time you start
Application information is read from a CSV file and passed to LinkedList. When we add or remove
visitor from LinkedList, the CSV file is updated.
